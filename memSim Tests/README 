# Memory Managment Simulator

Ethan Vosburg and Isaac Lake

Make it with make, and clean with make clean as usual.

Should you need to edit the TLB size for any testing
you will need to recompile it after changing the constant
present at the top of memSim.py

Have fun, and do not run this in Vivado...

Any other thing you want me to know while I am grading it.

We love you and we chose to use python becuase we chose to do it the easy way.
